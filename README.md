## Design Decisions

### Design Choices

This website was created with the idea of space or up in the athmosphere as those are the only times where you are able to see countries as a whole. The hope is to provide a website that is easily accessible.

### Color

For color I have kept it simple with the major colors being a dark shade of blue (#003f64) with aspects of white and black as the majority of the font colors.

### Fonts 

Mina with from Google Fonts was used for the majority of this project with a fall back of sans serif. Mina was specifically chosen as it slightly imitated characters that you you associate with space and flight.

## Structure of Pages

There are only two html files that this project consists of, index.html as well as the 404.html page.

- index.html: This is only a one page site whereby the rest of the content is hidden in modals. Content such as the rules as well as the contact form.
- 404.html: This is the only other page apart from the index.html. This page consists of an image with 404 written accross it as well as a button below it to be able to return back to the index.html page.
